# KNOW - Knowledge Network for Open Wisdom

An open protocol for extracting proven reasoning patterns from LLMs and compiling them into lightweight, deterministic, human-readable building blocks that any model or agent can invoke.

**The idea**: When an LLM solves a class of problem repeatedly, that solution should be captured, verified, and compiled -- so it never needs to be re-derived. Intelligence accumulates in the network, not in proprietary weights.

Read the [full concept paper](CONCEPT.md) for the architecture, the self-building loop, and why this matters.

## Status

This is a concept in development. We are looking for collaborators on the [open questions](CONCEPT.md#open-questions) -- particularly in reasoning efficiency, formal verification, agent architectures, and decentralized protocols.
